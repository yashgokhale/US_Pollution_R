# US_Pollution_Data Analysis using R
The analysis of USA Pollution Data was done using visualization tools in R. The base data was generated through https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html

The following things were studied in this analysis:
1. Visualization of Time Variance of Pollutants
2. Sample size consideration (Choose the right number of samples to be taken)
3. Linear Model for Temperature over the years
4. Linear Model for Relative Humidity over the years
5. Level-log and log-log transformation models
6. Plotting of Spatial Distribution graph
7. Confirming fulfillment of Gauss-Markov Assumptions

Further, a Graphical User Interface was also developed using tkinter to visualize the trends for a pollutant over time.
A short article on the same can be found at: https://medium.com/@ysg/a-gui-for-usa-pollution-trends-1c7a3627f150
The sample input and output for the GUI is as follows:
