# US_Pollution_Data Analysis using R
The analysis of USA Pollution Data was done using visualization tools in R. The base data was generated through https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html

![Summary](https://github.com/yashgokhale/US_Pollution_R/blob/master/uspollution_summary.jpg)

Combined data files have been made available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yKqv8DsB6o1szznw1qjfyM8zmG-egUOE?usp=sharingâ€‹
(Developed in collaboration with Ms. Madhulika Dashputre and Mr. Hariharan Ramasubramanian at CMU)

The following things were studied in this analysis:
1. Visualization of Time Variance of Pollutants
2. Sample size consideration (Choose the right number of samples to be taken)
3. Linear Model for Temperature over the years
4. Linear Model for Relative Humidity over the years
5. Level-log and log-log transformation models
6. Plotting of Spatial Distribution graph
7. Confirming fulfillment of Gauss-Markov Assumptions
